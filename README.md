# next_bechdel-Jupyter-
This is a guided project imported from Jupyter Notebooks

In this project you'll use data visualization techniques to analyze how the top 50 movies of 2016 performed according to the Bechdel Test and other representation-based tests.

The Bechdel-Wallace Test — often abbreviated to the "Bechdel Test" — evaluates movies based on two simple questions:
1.	Does the movie have at least two named female characters?
2.	And do those characters have at least one conversation that is not about a man?

To perform your visualization, you'll use a dataset called "The Next Bechdel Test" from fivethirtyeight.com

In addition to results of the Bechdel test, this dataset includes the results of similar representation tests developed by members of the movie industry and evaluated by fivethirtyeight.com.
